# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the system in **Ubuntu 18.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.2.0**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## Python
Required to calculate the alignment of the trajectory with the ground truth. **Required Numpy module**.

* (win) http://www.python.org/downloads/windows
* (deb) `sudo apt install libpython2.7-dev`
* (mac) preinstalled with osx

## Fastdeploy 
Required to deploy YOLOv8 model in c++ environment to detect dynamic object

You need to download the pre-compiled SDK and uncompress it in ThirdParty folder.
```
# Download the FastDeploy precompiled library. Users can choose your appropriate version in the `FastDeploy Precompiled Library` mentioned above
wget https://bj.bcebos.com/fastdeploy/release/cpp/fastdeploy-linux-x64-x.x.x.tgz
tar xvf fastdeploy-linux-x64-x.x.x.tgz

# 1. Download the official converted YOLOv8 ONNX model files
wget https://bj.bcebos.com/paddlehub/fastdeploy/yolov8s.onnx
```

## ROS (optional)

We provide some examples to process input of a monocular, monocular-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial or RGB-D camera using ROS. Building these examples is optional. These have been tested with ROS Melodic under Ubuntu 18.04.

# 3. Building system

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:SimonWXW/ORB_SLAM3-with-YOLO.git
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the system efficiently:
```
cd ORB_SLAM3-with-YOLO
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM3.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables in *Examples* folder.

# 4. Running system with your camera

Directory `Examples` contains several demo programs and calibration files to run ORB-SLAM3 in all sensor configurations with Intel Realsense cameras T265 and D435i. The steps needed to use your own camera are: 

1. Calibrate your camera following `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf` and write your calibration file `your_camera.yaml`

2. Modify one of the provided demos to suit your specific camera model, and build it

3. Connect the camera to your computer using USB3 or the appropriate interface

4. Run ORB-SLAM3. For example, for our D435i camera, we would execute:

```
./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/stereo_inertial_realsense_D435i Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/RealSense_D435i.yaml
```

# 6. TUM-RGBD Examples

1. Download a sequence from [http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download) and uncompress it.
2. Associate RGB images and depth images using the python script [associate.py](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools). We already provide associations for some of the sequences in *Examples/RGB-D/associations/*. You can generate your own associations file executing:
```
python associate.py rgbd_dataset_freiburg3_walking_xyz/rgb.txt rgbd_dataset_freiburg3_walking_xyz/depth.txt > associations.txt
```

## Evaluation
In TUM-RGBD ground truth is only available in the room where all sequences start and end. As a result the error measures the drift at the end of the sequence. 

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
evo_ape tum rgbd-tum-CameraTrajectory.txt ../dataset/rgbd_dataset_freiburg3_walking_xyz/groundtruth.txt -va -p --plot_mode xyz -a --correct_scale
```

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, mono-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial and RGB-D
Tested with ROS Melodic and ubuntu 18.04.

1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM3* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file:
  ```
  gedit ~/.bashrc
  ```
and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM3:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/ORB_SLAM3/Examples/ROS
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script:

  ```
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```
  

### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM3/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

**Running ROS example:** Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_02_medium.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab for a Stereo-Inertial configuration:
  ```
  roscore
  ```
  
  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo_Inertial Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo-Inertial/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```
  
  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_02_medium.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw /imu0:=/imu
  ```
  
Once ORB-SLAM3 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab.

**Remark:** For rosbags from TUM-VI dataset, some play issue may appear due to chunk size. One possible solution is to rebag them with the default chunk size, for example:
  ```
  rosrun rosbag fastrebag.py dataset-room1_512_16.bag dataset-room1_512_16_small_chunks.bag
  ```

# 8. Running time analysis
A flag in `include\Config.h` activates time measurements. It is necessary to uncomment the line `#define REGISTER_TIMES` to obtain the time stats of one execution which is shown at the terminal and stored in a text file(`ExecTimeMean.txt`).

# 9. Calibration
You can find a tutorial for visual-inertial calibration and a detailed description of the contents of valid configuration files at  `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf`
